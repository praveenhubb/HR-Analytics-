## 🧩 Project Overview

The dashboard helps answer questions like:

- How many employees are currently on service?
- What is the **gender split** across the organization?
- How many employees are **due for promotion**?
- Which **job roles and departments** have higher retrenchment risk?
- How is **job satisfaction** distributed (High / Medium / Low)?
